# RMarkdown Web Renderer

This web app renders RMarkdown text in an html textarea via PHP and R, as various output types. 

This is ONLY the webserver side. It includes the frontend scripts and PHP needed to run, but assumes a sibling R application that will catch the data and do the rendering. It also assumes a local webserver install like xampp.
